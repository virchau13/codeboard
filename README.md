## What's this fork for?

This fork simply just adds the following features:
- Enables the Shift key for numbers/punctuation as well (e.g. Shift+`3` => `#`, Shift+`;` => `:`)
- Replaces the shortened versions of modifier keys (CTRL, SHFT, ESC, and TAB) with Unicode variants (✲ off / ⎈ on, ⇧ off / ⇪ on, ⎋, and ↹ respectively.)

@gazlaws-dev did all the hard work here, support them, not me.

The rest of the README is the same as the original except edited for clarity a little.

## Coding on your mobile device just got easier. No more switching between numbers, symbols and alphabets.

### Features:
- Cut, copy, paste, select all
- Tab
- All the braces {[&lt;(
- ; / \ ! | &$ etc
- No ads or IAP, made for students!
